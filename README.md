# Traffic Crime Correlations

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore correlations between traffic incidents and crime data in Austin, Texas. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on these datasets, our goal was to uncover potential patterns and insights that could provide valuable information for urban planning, law enforcement, and public safety initiatives.

## Tools Used:
- __City of Austin Open Data Portal:__ We sourced our data from the City of Austin's Open Data Portal, which provides access to a wide range of datasets related to traffic incidents and crime reports in the city.

- __API Integration:__ We leveraged APIs provided by the Open Data Portal to retrieve the latest data on traffic incidents and crime reports.

- __Python Jupyter Notebook:__ Our data analysis was conducted using Python programming language within Jupyter Notebook. This environment allowed us to manipulate, clean, and analyze the datasets efficiently.

- __Pandas and NumPy:__ These Python libraries were used for data manipulation and preprocessing, making it easier to perform calculations and transformations on the datasets.

- __Matplotlib:__ We used Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library, to create informative graphs and charts to visualize the relationships and trends within the data.

## Data Sources
We obtained our data from the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/). Specifically, we focused on two main datasets:

1. __Traffic Incidents:__ This dataset includes information about various traffic incidents, such as accidents, road closures, and traffic congestion. The data provides details on location, time, and incident type.

2. __Crime Reports:__ The crime reports dataset contains information about reported crimes within Austin. It includes data on crime types, locations, and timestamps.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations
In our Python Jupyter Notebook, we performed exploratory data analysis on the combined traffic incidents and crime reports datasets. Our analysis involved:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Exploring trends and correlations between different types of traffic incidents and crime reports.
- Creating visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, to visually represent the relationships and patterns within the data.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aimed to uncover insights into the potential correlations between traffic incidents and crime reports in Austin, Texas. Through our analysis of the data from the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/), we gained a deeper understanding of the relationships between these two important datasets. Further research and findings like these could contribute to urban planning, law enforcement strategies, and public safety initiatives in the city.
